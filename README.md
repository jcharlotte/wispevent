## Event & Activities 
- index.php was meant to let the participants chose what card to be turned
- the bigger cards could not be turned untill the countdown reached 0
- the list on the left would let particpants know where the current activity was taking place
- the "rabbit" card was buggy and bug is still unknown, but if it wasn't the first one to be turned, it wouldn't be counted in the countdown (we called it fishbug)

## Prize giveaway
- fillDatabase.php was used to add participants in the database, based on what prizes they wanted to get
- prizes.php allowed to display ranodmly selected winners every prizes
- the code was made so we could decide at the last minute if people would be allowed to win several big prizes or not
